This repos will contain my FYP project and will stay as a basis for further development. Future plans are some more tools regarding the map creation and tools which make more use of the location data than the currently existing show position application.

Another task will be the implementation of several other hardware devices (like WLAN, bluetooth, and perhaps some other exotic hardware like the Ekahau rfid/WLAN tags)
