 I want to thank everyone who was related to this project. At first there are my supervisors Carolin Bauer and Graham Mansfield who helped me a lot with their good suggestions about what I could do better and what went wrong. Then I want to thank the people from Bitmanufaktur (\url{http://www.bitmanufaktur.de/}) for their hardware and support. I also want to thank the people from Trolltech for their great framework and the qt-interest mailing list who helped me out when I got strange and stupid questions regarding the Qt framework.

 I also want to thank the friends of mine who helped me with \LaTeX\verb= =  and read over my report.

 And last but not least I want to thank all the people who create Linux, KDE and all the great tools that I used for creating my project and sped up my progress.
