  Notes on use of the project logbook
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item The student and supervisor must arrange regular supervisory meetings to review progress and make plans for the project.  It is the purpose of the Project Logbook to document these meetings and therefore build up a record of the student's progress throughout the project;
   \item The student should prepare for the supervisory meeting by deciding which questions he or she needs to ask the supervisor and what progress has been made since the last meeting (if applicable) and noting these in the relevant sections of the sheet, effectively forming an agenda for the meeting;
   \item The business of the meeting should be noted briefly as items in the relevant section of the sheet.  There will be one sheet for each supervisory meeting and the actions on the student (and perhaps the supervisor) which should be carried out before the next meeting should be noted briefly in the relevant section of the sheet;
   \item The Project Logbook is one of the deliverables from the project and is an important record of the student's organisation and learning experience.  The student should ensure that it is handed in as an appendix of the report, with sheets dated and numbered consecutively to show a consistent record of the supervisory meetings;
